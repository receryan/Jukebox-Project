# Jukebox-Projects
Hello and welcome!

This project was created over the course of the Fall 2021 semester at my university. The assignment given was to work in a group of 3 people to develop a software of our choice while carefully using and updating the proper documentation associated with software engineering practices (i.e., UML Diagrams, SDLC models, Case Diagrams, State Diagrams, SRS Documentation, etc.). This project utilizes a basic queue data structure to allow users in a given session to search and play songs through the Spotify API. Some other functionalities included are the separation of users into Host and Participant, the ability to veto songs, force kick users, creating and joining sessions, and so on. This application utilizes Flask (Python) for maintaining user and song databases with GET and PULL requests, JavaScript for functions not directly tied to dataset manipulation, and HTML5/CSS3 for aesthetic characteristics.

*Note: This project has not been fully finished and is still in its "alpha" stage of development. Some of the features designed to be incorporated may be unfinished as of writing this.
