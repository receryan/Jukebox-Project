# Projects
Hello and welcome to my personal repository of programming projects!

This repository contains all of the programming projects I have completed during my time in college. Most of what is contained in this repository was created for various class assignments/projects, although there also does contain projects that I have chosen to develop independently. As with any project, I would never claim that the ways in which these projects were developed are "perfect," as there always remains room for improvement. With that being said, thanks for visiting!
